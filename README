CAD::ProEngineer is an XS wrapper around the Pro/Toolkit (Pro/Engineer API) 
libraries to provide the functions as perl subroutines.  A required element 
is a Pro/Toolkit program with an embedded perl interpreter, which will use 
this module to access Pro/Toolkit code.  An example of the necessary 
interpreter code can be found in the 'perl561' subfolder, which also contains 
unlocked binaries for Windows and Solaris.  These binaries may have hardcoded 
paths so your mileage may vary.
